# SVG Tree Vue3

This is some simple SVG tree components for Vue3.

The [demo page](https://theverydarkness.github.io/svg-tree-vue3/), which is also used for testing, is available.

## Usage

[Here](./src/App.vue) is an example of how to use the component.

Currently, almost all the props are not reactive, so you may need to use `key` to force the component to re-render.
